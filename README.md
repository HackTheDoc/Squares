# The Square Cult is invading Earth !

- ## Easy
    Well, just 1 to 10 squares to kill... not so difficult right ?

- ## Normal
    A hundred ? with the possibility to **Q**uit the battle ?

    Still to easy for the warrior that you are !

- ## Hard
    A full legion of no more than a thousand squares !
    
    This is starting to be serious... but don't worry you still can **Q**uit the battle.

- ## Little Hell
    The legions won't stop coming !

    You shall kill them all, only if you have enough power.

- ## Big Hell
    This is the end ! The squares have kill almost every human !

    Do you think you can save the humanity ?

# How to play ?
Just download the appropriate file in each directory :
    
    - .exe for windows users
    - no extensions for linux users

Then... just click on them to KILL THEM ALL !

*PS: hop you'll have fun*
